/// \brief Container storing all quantities used within the simulations.
///
/// Storage provides a convenient way to store quantities, iterate over specified subset of quantities, modify
/// quantities etc. Every quantity is a \ref Quantity object and is identified by \ref QuantityId key. The
/// quantities are stored as key-value pairs; for every \ref QuantityId there can be at most one \ref Quantity
/// stored.
///
/// Storage can contain scalar, vector, tensor and integer quantities. Every quantity can also have associated
/// one or two derivatives. There is no constraint on quantity order or type for given \ref QuantityId, i.e.
/// as far as \ref Storage object is concerned, one can create a QuantityId::ENERGY tensor quantity with
/// second derivatives or integer quantity QuantityId::SOUND_SPEED. Different parts of the code require
/// certain types for some quantities, though. Particle positions, QuantityId::POSITION, are mostly assumed
/// to be vector quantities of second order. Inconsistency of types will cause an assert when encountered.
///
/// Storage can hold arbitrary number of materials, objects derived from \ref IMaterial. In theory,
/// every particle can have a different material (different equation of state, different rheology, ...).
/// The storage can also exist with no material; this is a valid state, useful for situations where no
/// material is necessary. A storage with material can be created using constructor
/// Storage(AutoPtr<IMaterial>&& material). All particles subsequently added into the storage
/// will have the material passed in the parameter of the constructor. Storage with multiple materials can
/// then be created by merging the storage with another object, using function \ref merge.
///
/// Storage is not thread-safe. If used in multithreaded context, any calls of member functions must be
/// synchonized by the caller.
///
/// The following demostrates how to access the particle data:
/// \code
/// // Get particle masses from the storage
/// ArrayView<Float> m = storage.getValue<Float>(QuantityId::MASS);
/// std::cout << "Mass of 5th particle = " << m[5] << std::endl;
///
/// // Get particle velocities (=derivative of positions) and accelerations (=second derivative of positions)
/// ArrayView<Vector> v = storage.getDt<Vector>(QuantityId::POSITION);
/// ArrayView<Vector> dv = storage.getD2t<Vector>(QuantityId::POSITION);
///
/// // To get values and all derivatives at once, we can use the getAll function. The function returns an
/// // array containing all buffers, which can be "decomposed" into individual variables using tie function
/// // (similarly to std::tie).
/// ArrayView<Vector> r;
/// tie(r, v, dv) = storage.getAll<Vector>(QuantityId::POSITION); // return value is "decomposed"
///
/// // Lastly, if we want to get multiple values (not derivatives) of the same type, we can use getValues. We
/// // can also utilize the function tie; make sure to list the variables in the same order as the IDs.
/// ArrayView<Float> rho, u;
/// tie(rho, u, m) = storage.getValues<Float>(QuantityId::DENSITY, QuantityId::ENERGY, QuantityId::MASS);
/// \endcode
///
/// When adding a new quantity into the storage, it is necessary to specify the type of the quantity and the
/// number of derivatives using \ref OrderEnum. Quantity can be either initialized by providing a single
/// default value (used for all particles), or an array of values; see functions \ref insert. To add arbitrary
/// quantity, use:
/// \code
/// // Fill the array of angular frequencies
/// Array<Vector> omega(storage.getParticleCnt());
/// omega.fill(Vector(0, 0, 5)); // initialize it to 5 rad/s parallel to z-axis.
/// // Add angular frequencies to the storage, evolved as first-order quantity
/// storage.insert<Vector>(QuantityId::ANGULAR_FREQUENCY, OrderEnum::FIRST, std::move(omega));
///
/// // Add moment of inertia (with no derivatives)
/// const SymmetricTensor I = Rigid::sphereInertia(3, 2); // moment of a sphere with mass 3kg and radius 2m
/// storage.insert<SymmetricTensor>(QuantityId::MOMENT_OF_INERTIA, OrderEnum::ZERO, I);
/// \endcode
///
/// In some cases, it is useful to read or modify all quantities in the storage, without the need to fetch
/// them manually using \ref getValue and related function. There are two different ways to iterate over
/// quantities stored in storage. You can use the function \ref getQuantities, which returns a range (pair of
/// iterators) and thus allows to visit quantities in a for-loop:
/// \code
/// for (StorageElement element : storage.getQuantities()) {
///     std::cout << "Quantity " << element.id << std::endl
///     std::cout << " - order " << int(element.quantity.getOrderEnum()) << std::endl;
///     std::cout << " - type  " << int(element.quantity.getValueEnum()) << std::endl;
/// }
/// \endcode
/// This approach can be utilized to access properties of the quantities (as in the example above), clone
/// quantities, etc. The downside is that we still need to know the value type to actually access the quantity
/// values. To overcome this problem and access the quantity values in generic (type-agnostic) way, consider
/// using the function \ref iterate:
/// \code
/// // Iterate over all first order quantities in the storage
/// iterate<VisitorEnum::FIRST_ORDER>(storage, [](QuantityId id, auto& values, auto& derivatives) {
///     // Values and derivatives are arrays with quantity values. The type of the values can be Float,
///     // Vector, SymmetricTensor, etc., depending on the actual type of the stored quantity. Therefore, we
///     // can only use generic code here (functions overload for all quantity types).
///     std::cout << "Quantity " << id << std::endl;
///     std::cout << "Particle 0: " << values[0] << ", derivative ", derivatives[0] << std::endl;
/// });
///
/// // Iterates over all arrays in the storage, meaning all quantity values and derivatives.
/// iterate<VisitorEnum::ALL_BUFFERS>(storage, [](auto& array) {
///     // Use decltype to determine the type of the array
///     using Type = std::decay_t<decltype(array)>::Type;
///
///     // Set all values and all derivatives to zero (zero vector, zero tensor)
///     array.fill(Type(0._f));
/// });
/// \endcode
/// Note that arguments of the provided functor differ for each \ref VisitorEnum.
